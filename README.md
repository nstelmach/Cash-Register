# Cash-Register FreeCodeCamp 

In this task, I was to write a cash register drawer function that accepts purchase price, payment, and cash-in-drawer as the arguments. It should return an object with a status and a change. To do this project, I used my JavaScript knowledge about functions, objects, arrays, reduce functions, if else statements, rest opertors and for in loops.
